# OldProgramNaiveGeneticCProgram

This is some older code that I put up for a few reasons but mostly for preservation; I have not touched this code in a long time and don't really plan on adding to it.
This code does use a GOTO... I believe that GOTO can be fine to use as long is it is not abused and in some cases it can be preferable when using C. I wrote this program in visual studio
but is should work with any C compiler that implements the time.h header and the random function I use. I can't really think of any reason why this would not work on some system unless
that system is really obscure, uses an obscure subset of C, or treats the variables in some way that there is not enough space on the stack to implement the structs since I don't really
do any manipulations to add things to the heap.
